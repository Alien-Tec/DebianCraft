Alien-OS DebianCraft

is a minimal distro based on Debian 12.1 with Linux Kernel 6.4
and the Archcraft look and feel - just without Arch. ;-)

10 preinstalled BSPWM themes!
Firefox, Alacritty, Oh-My-Zsh, Synaptic, Thunar, Geany and the MX-Tools are preinstalled and that's basically it.
A perfect base for your own project!

This was done just for testing purposes and will not be continued!

Login: demo
